            <h3 class="work-title black fade-in">Context</h3>
            <p class="work-text grey">
              As a Product Designer at Zé Express, I worked on a cutting-edge solution to enhance the shopping experience in our smart, self-service stores. These stores, powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning, provide a quick and cost-effective way to purchase beverages in locations like condominiums, gyms, and offices.
            </p>
            <p class="work-text grey">Our goal was twofold:</p>
            <p class="work-text grey"><span class="span-black">1. Improve the shopping journey</span> to increase user satisfaction and retention while maintaining compliance with age-restricted purchases.</p>
            <p class="work-text grey"><span class="span-black">2.Prepare for business expansion</span> into new markets such as universities, subways, and hotels.</p>
            <p class="work-text grey">This project tackled complex challenges in balancing legal, business, and user needs while delivering a scalable solution for future growth.</p>

                  <h3 class="work-title black fade-in">Problem</h3>
                  <p class="work-text grey">The existing shopping experience faced obstacles that impacted both users and business performance:</p>
                  <p class="work-text grey"><span class="span-black">1. High rejection rate (9%)</span> for facial validation: External factors like poor lighting, blurry photos, and prank attempts created frustration and inefficiency.</p>
                  <p class="work-text grey"><span class="span-black">2. Lengthy shopping time (66 seconds):</span> The process was slower than expected, leading to user dissatisfaction.</p>
                  <p class="work-text grey"><span class="span-black">3. Inefficient user flow:</span> Bureaucratic steps disrupted the seamless shopping experience, creating frustration.</p>
                  <p class="work-text grey"><span class="span-black">4. Scalability challenges:</span> Errors and the cumbersome process limited our ability to expand into new locations.

            <h3 class="work-title black fade-in">User Insights</h3>
            <p class="work-text grey">
              To uncover the root causes of these issues, I employed qualitative and quantitative research methods:
            </p>
            <p class="work-text grey"><span class="span-black">→ Purchase  reviews:</span> To gather behavioral insights from real interactions.
              <br><span class="span-black">→ Data analysis:</span> To investigate patterns in rejected validations.
              <br><span class="span-black">→ User interviews:</span> To understand their pain points and perceptions.
            </p>
            <p class="work-text grey span-black fade-in">Key Findings:</p>
            <p class="work-text grey"><span class="span-black">“The process feels bureaucratic.”</span> Users were frustrated by repetitive validation steps for each purchase.</p>
            <p class="work-text grey"><span class="span-black">“Why do I need to do this every time?”</span> The need for frequent validation negatively impacted trust and satisfaction.</p>
            <p class="work-text grey"><span class="span-black">Disrupted flow:</span> The act of taking a photo and waiting for analysis interrupted the natural rhythm of shopping.</p>
            <p class="work-text grey"><span class="span-black">External factors:</span> Issues like poor lighting, shaky hands, and prank photos were major contributors to validation failures.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="full-text pad-bottom">
            <h3 class="work-title black fade-in">Approach</h3>
            <p class="work-text grey">
              <span class="span-black">1. Research and discovery:</span>
              <br>&emsp;→ Conducted qualitative and quantitative research to identify root causes of friction.
              <br>&emsp;→ Collaborated with the engineering and compliance teams to understand technical constraints and legal requirements.
            </p>
            <p class="work-text grey">
              <span class="span-black">2. Strategic design alignment:</span>
              <br>&emsp;→ Advocated for leveraging native biometric authentication (fingerprint/face ID) to simplify the process, reduce errors, and ensure compliance.
              <br>&emsp;→ Gained buy-in from stakeholders by presenting a clear roadmap showing how the solution aligned with both user goals and business expansion objectives.
            </p>
            <p class="work-text grey">
              <span class="span-black">3. Iterative prototyping and testing:</span>
              <br>&emsp;→ Designed prototypes for iOS and Android platforms, emphasizing native biometrics integration.
              <br>&emsp;→ Conducted usability tests with users in controlled environments to refine the solution based on feedback.

                  <p class="work-text grey">
                    The final solution introduced native biometrics as the primary validation method, while retaining facial validation as an alternative. Key features included:
                  </p>
                  <p class="work-text grey"><span class="span-black">Simplified shopping flow:</span>
                    <br>
                    Biometric activation to the main screen, reducing unnecessary steps and friction.</p>
                  <p class="work-text grey"><span class="span-black">Instant feedback:</span>
                    <br>
                    Real-time responses for errors allowed users to quickly resolve issues without disrupting the experience.</p>
                  <p class="work-text grey"><span class="span-black">Platform-specific designs:</span>
                    <br>
                    Tailored interfaces and interactions for iOS and Android to ensure a seamless, native experience.</p>
                  <p class="work-text grey"><span class="span-black">Flexibility for users:</span>
                    <br>
                    Offered users the choice to switch between biometric and facial validation, improving accessibility and adoption.</p>
