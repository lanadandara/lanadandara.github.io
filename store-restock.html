            <p class="work-text grey">
              In this project, we had two primary user groups: our logistics team and our partners. To initiate the research, I delved into understanding the unique journeys of these users. Firstly, I spent a week shadowing our logistics team, documenting the tools they utilized and comprehending their workflow. Subsequently, I immersed myself in the field, shadowing four of our partners during their store visits to gain valuable insights into their routines.
              <br><br>
              Key insights gathered were:

            <p class="work-subtitle primary">Partners</p>
            <p class="work-text grey bulletpoint">
              ➡️  Partners printed visit information for reference during their visits.
              <br>➡️  They navigated between different store locations using address information from the printed paper.
              <br>➡️  Efficiency was crucial, aiming for shorter visits to accommodate more locations in a day.
              <br>➡️  Inputting visit details into our system was cumbersome due to an unwieldy online form, especially on their low-capacity smartphones.
              <br>➡️  Partners relied on store Wi-Fi for form completion.
            </p>
            <p class="work-subtitle primary">Logistic team</p>
            <p class="work-text grey bulletpoint">
              ➡️  Operational management relied heavily on spreadsheets.
              <br>➡️  Communication with partners was primarily via WhatsApp messages.
              <br>➡️  Vital data was manually saved and inputted into our data lakes.

              One of our primary objectives during this stage of the process was to gain a comprehensive understanding of the journeys of both user groups, their points of intersection, and the required data exchange.

                  <p class="work-text grey">
                    We subjected our prototype to usability testing involving 3 field partners and 3 members of our logistics team. During in-store visits with our field partners, we made the following observations:
                    <br><br>➡️  Emphasized the need for most app actions to be easily executed single-handedly, given that they operate the app while conducting tasks during the visit.
                    <br><br>➡️  Modified the sequence of actions to align with the partners' existing fieldwork practices.
                    <br><br>➡️  Implemented auto-fill for certain fields to enhance the user experience, while incorporating mandatory fields to ensure thorough form completion by the partners.

              <p class="work-text grey">
                The web app, the final product, eliminated the need for app downloads and saved storage space on our partner's devices. It significantly improved their routines, reducing the average time spent on store visits by 4 minutes.

              <p class="work-subtitle primary">Maximizing team productivity</p>
              <p class="work-text grey">
                The integration between this app and our back-office platform automated 30% of the logistics team's tasks related to the restocking process. This allowed our team to redirect their focus towards more critical aspects.
              </p>
              <p class="work-subtitle primary">Seamless Data Integration</p>
              <p class="work-text grey">
                We successfully achieved 100% seamless integration of the entire restocking process with our data sources, resulting in comprehensive documentation and significantly improved data accuracy compared to previous methods.

            <p class="work-text grey">
              We've received valuable feedback from both user groups regarding potential improvements. To address specific product features that offer more flexibility for exception cases during store visits, we've conducted an additional three shadowing sessions.
            </p>
            <p class="work-subtitle primary">UI Enhancement</p>
            <p class="work-text grey">
              During the project development, our available data integrations were limited, so we could only provide product names to our partners. However, as we onboard new partners, we noticed an initial challenge for them in identifying products solely by name. To address this, we have analyzed and designed a product selection interface with images, simplifying this aspect of the task.
