            <h3 class="work-title blue">Research</h3>
            <p class="work-subtitle pink">What approaches do other companies take with digital wallets and transactions?</p>
            <p class="work-text grey">
              We conducted a benchmark analysis, investigating coupon usage in apps like iFood, Zé Delivery, and Rappi (our competitors in the Delivery category). We also closely examined transaction scenarios within popular digital wallets such as Starbucks and Uber.
              <br><br>
              Key findings encompass:
              <br>• The variety of payment methods available for purchasing digital funds
              <br>• The consistent placement of coupon selection at the checkout stage in delivery apps
              <br>• Automated selection of coupons or wallets by some companies
              <br>• The important role of Starbucks cashiers in reminding customers about using their digital wallet in a phygital context
            </p>
            <p class="work-subtitle pink">What is our customer purchase behavior?</p>
            <p class="work-text grey">
              Through an in-app survey, we collected user feedback on promotions and payments. Out of 587 responses, we discovered that:
              <br><br>
              <br>• 47% of respondents do not notice our promotions
              <br>• 34% are not interested in the discounted items
              <br>• 71% desire more payment options
              <br>• Promotions or discounts rank as the second most influential purchase factor
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="full-text">
            <h3 class="work-title blue">Build</h3>
            <p class="work-text grey">
              To minimize friction in our purchase journey, our old purchase process did not have any payment selection. All payment actions were handled in a separate section of our app. However, unlike our benchmarked competitors who have a digital 'checkout' process, we needed to integrate payment actions on our home screen. This would allow users to opt for their digital wallet as a payment method before proceeding with their purchase.
            </p>
            <p class="work-text grey">
              To create a sense of familiarity akin to coupon usage, our promotion funds operate similarly. Users need to enter a personalized code to add promotional funds to their wallets.

                  <h3 class="work-title blue">Usability tests</h3>
                  <p class="work-text grey">
                    To evaluate this new feature, we carried out a usability test involving 7 users, both new and existing.
                    <br><br>
                    The key takeaway from the test was that our existing users, accustomed to the previous purchase process, quickly bypassed our home screen, overlooking the new payment selection feature. In contrast, new users easily discovered this feature.
                    <br><br>
                    Based on this insight, we recognized the necessity for an onboarding campaign to introduce our users to this new feature.

            <p class="work-text grey">
              In addition to introducing new screen designs, adjustments were required in our backend purchase flow checks. We also had to integrate our refund and rewards back-office platform with the user app to ensure a seamless credit exchange process. Consequently, we not only detailed this information in our design handoff file but also held a dedicated meeting to verify all backend connections were accurately accounted for.

              <p class="work-text grey">
                It's not clear to our existing users that they can now select and set their payment method before the purchase process. As a result, although we observed 38% fewer customer tickets for payment issues, we also noticed a new surge of 11% in tickets from users struggling to effectively utilize their wallet credits.

              <p class="work-subtitle pink">Increase in customer loyalty: Rewards Test</p>
              <p class="work-text grey">
                In a user survey conducted for a separate project, we experimented with utilizing digital credits as a reward for survey completion. Surprisingly, out of the three reward options available, an overwhelming 91% of customers opted for digital credits as their preferred reward.

            <p class="work-text grey">
              As we explore new payment options, we are actively developing the ability for users to purchase credits through Pix (Brazilian instant payment ecosystem). This initiative will enable individuals without access to debit or credit cards to shop conveniently at our smart fridges.
