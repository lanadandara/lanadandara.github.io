            <p class="work-text grey">Zé Express transforms beverage shopping with smart fridges located in condominiums. Customers unlock the fridge using an app, select their drinks, and let AI handle the checkout after closing the door.            </p>
            <p class="work-text grey span-black">THE CHALLENGE</p>
            <p class="work-text grey">We needed to address two pressing business problems simultaneously:</p>
            <p class="work-text grey"><span class="span-black">1. Tailored Promotions</span> to boost purchase frequency and revenue.</p>
            <p class="work-text grey"><span class="span-black">2. Streamlined Refunds</span> to improve user satisfaction by reducing a 60-day processing time.</p>

                <div class="half">
                  <h3 class="work-title black fade-in">Research</h3>
                  <p class="work-text grey span-black">PROBLEM ANALYSIS</p>
                  <p class="work-text grey">The previous system disconnected payment actions (e.g., wallet, promotions, refunds) from the shopping experience. Users could only manage these in a separate section of the app, leading to frustration and missed opportunities for engagement.</p>
                  <p class="work-text grey span-black">UNDERSTANDING USERS AND COMPETITORS</p>
                  <p class="work-text grey">To frame the problem, I combined insights from two sources:</p>
                  <p class="work-text grey"><span class="span-black">1.User Feedback:</span> An in-app survey with 587 responses highlighted key pain points:</p>
                  <p class="work-text grey">
                    → 47% didn’t notice promotions.
                    <br>→ 71% wanted more payment options.
                    <br>→ Promotions were the second-most influential factor for purchases.
                  </p>
                  <p class="work-text grey"><span class="span-black">2.Competitive Benchmarking:</span> Analyzed apps like iFood, Zé Delivery, Starbucks, and Uber:</p>
                  <p class="work-text grey">
                    → The consistent placement of coupon selection at the checkout stage in delivery apps.
                    <br>→ Automated selection of coupons or wallets by some companies.
                    <br>→ The important role of Starbucks cashiers in reminding customers about using their digital wallet in a phygital context.
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div class="half centerImg">

            <h3 class="work-title black fade-in">Strategy & Design Decisions</h3>
            <p class="work-text grey span-black">1. Reframing the Purchase Journey:</p>
            <p class="work-text grey">
              The first step was breaking down the existing flow into smaller components to identify friction points. Payment selection was entirely separate from the home screen, so I designed a new flow to embed wallet functionality into the shopping process.</p>
            <p class="work-text grey"><span class="span-black">Old Flow:</span>
              <br>Users accessed payment features in a separate app section, creating friction and disengagement.
            </p>
            <p class="work-text grey"><span class="span-black">New Flow:</span>
              <br>Added wallet to the home screen for easier visibility.
              <br>Enabled users to select payment methods (wallet, credit card, or promotions) before unlocking the fridge.
            </p>
            <p class="work-text grey span-black">2. Streamlining Refunds with Back-End Integration:</p>
            <p class="work-text grey">The refund process was a major operational bottleneck, requiring 60 days due to third-party payment processing. I worked closely with engineers and customer support to build:
              <br>→ An automated refund system directly linked to the digital wallet, reducing delays to instant refunds.
              <br>→ A back-office management tool for customer support to manage refunds efficiently.
            </p>

          <div class="full-text pad-bottom">
            <h3 class="work-title black fade-in">Testing & Alignment</h3>
            <p class="work-text grey span-black">USABILITY TESTING</p>
            <p class="work-text grey">
              I conducted usability tests with a mix of new and existing customers:
              <br>
              <br><span class="span-black">→ New Users:</span> Quickly discovered the wallet and promotions on the home screen.
              <br><span class="span-black">→ Existing Users:</span> Struggled to notice the change due to familiarity with the old flow.
            </p>
            <p class="work-text grey">
              To address this gap, I pitched an onboarding campaign to the marketing team, focusing on educating users about the updated features. This involved:
              <br>
              <br>→ In-app popups explaining the wallet.
              <br>→ Social media campaign announcing new feature.
            </p>
            <p class="work-text grey span-black">PERSUASION</p>
            <p class="work-text grey">Convincing stakeholders to prioritize this onboarding initiative required emphasizing how it aligned with the business goal of increasing feature adoption. I presented data from usability tests and the user survey to secure buy-in.</p>

                    <br>Loyal customers increased purchases to 4x/week, compared to 2x/week for the average user.</p>
                  <p class="work-text grey"><span class="span-black">2. Revenue Impact</span>
                    <br>Executed 800+ personalized promotions, driving a 68% increase in revenue.</p>
                  <p class="work-text grey"><span class="span-black">3. Operational Efficiency</span>
                    <br>The instant refund system reduced refund-related support tickets by 38%.</p>
                  <p class="work-text grey"><span class="span-black">4. User Feedback</span>
                    <br>A post-launch survey for another project revealed that 91% of users preferred wallet credits as rewards, highlighting the potential for deeper wallet integration in future initiatives.</p>
