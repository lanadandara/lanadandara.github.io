              <br><br>
              In 2023, the company embarked on an ambitious expansion strategy, envisioning a network of franchisees. To uphold our commitment to delivering a genuinely seamless and uncomplicated experience for not only our customers but also our prospective franchisees, we recognized the need for a platform that would empower our franchisees in managing their stores.

            <p class="work-subtitle pink">Stakeholders interviews</p>
            <p class="work-text grey">
              Initiating this project involved conducting interviews with key stakeholders within the company. These interviews were aimed at understanding the primary objectives of the product, the responsibilities franchisees would shoulder, aspects the company aimed to emphasize or de-emphasize, and the success metrics they anticipated.
            </p>
            <p class="work-subtitle pink">Audience interviews</p>
            <p class="work-text grey">
              Next, we conducted interviews with 4 franchisees from partner companies to gain insights into their operational routines, operational dynamics, and expectations when a franchise offers a dedicated platform.
              <br><br>
              Key Insights from the Interviews:
              <br><br>
              <br>• Emphasizing the light workload for franchisees was crucial, and should be reflected in our platform design.
              <br>• All customer relations were to be handled by our company, relieving franchises of this responsibility.
              <br>• Physical in-store responsibilities were limited to cleaning and restocking; other actions were to be managed remotely through our platform.
              <br>• Franchisees desired a sense of ownership over their stores, not just managerial roles.
              <br>• They expected comprehensive support and guidance from the company on store management.
              <br>• Daily, they sought insights into problems requiring immediate attention, reserving specific times each week for in-depth analyses and information review.
            </p>
            <p class="work-subtitle pink">Benchmark analysis</p>
            <p class="work-text grey">
              Subsequently, we conducted a benchmark analysis to assess both our existing back-office platform and similar franchise platforms available in the market. While our current back-office platform provided a comprehensive foundation, it was primarily designed for our internal team and lacked the desired level of user-friendliness for franchisees.
              <br><br>
              Our market analysis revealed platforms that fell into two extremes: some were overloaded with features, resulting in a confusing user experience, while others were overly specialized, focusing only on a few aspects of franchise management. Our goal was to strike a balance by encompassing all essential aspects of franchise management (operations, marketing, communication, and finance) while maintaining a simple and focused approach.

            <h3 class="work-title blue">Build</h3>
            <p class="work-text grey">
              Our primary task involved defining the information architecture and differentiating between features and pages accessible to both our internal team and franchisees. We ensured that the content within these pages catered to the specific needs of each user type.
            </p>
            <p class="work-text grey">
              Additionally, we introduced a new structural design incorporating summary sections and strategically placed call-to-action zones on every page. This ensured the prompt delivery of key information to the user in each section.

                  <h3 class="work-title blue">Usability tests</h3>
                  <p class="work-text grey">
                    We subjected our prototype to usability testing with 4 franchisees to evaluate the user-friendliness of our new platform. A key insight was that given the new nature of the business for franchisees, they required a learning curve to comprehend the platform's functionalities fully. However, providing a comprehensive company presentation before testing improved their ease of use. Consequently, we recognized the need to develop onboarding content for our future franchisees.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition, we accompanied our sales team during live platform demonstrations at events. We diligently documented pertinent questions and comments, particularly focused on the operational and financial aspects. This feedback prompted us to enhance our platform by incorporating additional report options and filters to address these specific needs.

            <h3 class="work-title blue">Development & launch</h3>
            <p class="work-text grey">
              Given the necessity to leverage our existing back-office platform as a foundation for this new product, we collaborated closely with the development team from the project's start. Our focus was on architecting a permission-based system that accommodates diverse user roles, granting access to specific platform content.
              <br><br>
              This also presented an ideal opportunity to modernize the UI and enhance features that were previously overlooked in our old back-office platform. All modifications and newly introduced elements were meticulously documented in our handoff file.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="full-text">
            <h3 class="work-title blue">Next steps</h3>
            <p class="work-text grey">
              As we welcome new franchisees through the sales and administrative processes, we are concurrently developing onboarding and training materials. Our internal teams are actively utilizing certain features to gather data and feedback. This valuable input will aid in refining the platform while we await the completion of the contract phase with our first set of franchisees.
            </p>
            <p class="work-subtitle pink">Scaling with mega franchisees</p>
            <p class="work-text grey">
              Initially, the project catered to smaller franchisees with up to 10 stores. However, with an evolving company strategy targeting medium to large franchisees (ranging from 50 to 100 stores), we've initiated a fresh research cycle. The goal is to identify necessary changes and features that ensure the same user-friendly experience while accommodating up to 10 times more stores.
