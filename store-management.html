            <p class="work-text grey">
              As a Senior Product Designer at Zé Express, I spearheaded the design of a responsive desktop platform to empower franchisees to manage their smart beverage coolers seamlessly. This initiative was part of Zé Express's 2023 expansion strategy, which aimed to onboard new franchisees while maintaining operational efficiency and simplicity. Collaborating closely with a junior designer, I worked to deliver a solution that balanced the needs of both franchisees and the business.

            <p class="work-text grey"><span class="span-black">1. At-a-glance clarity:</span> Deliver operational insights on all stores in one comprehensive view.</p>
            <p class="work-text grey"><span class="span-black">2. Simplified decision-making:</span> Prioritize actions and present them intuitively to franchisees.</p>
              <p class="work-text grey"><span class="span-black">3. Efficiency through reuse:</span> Leverage the existing back-office platform to minimize development time and resources.</p>

                  <h3 class="work-title black fade-in">Problem</h3>
                  <p class="work-text grey">The existing back-office platform, designed for internal teams, lacked the user-friendliness required for franchisees. Franchise operations required simplicity and clarity while ensuring franchisees could manage their stores efficiently. Key challenges included:</p>
                  <p class="work-text grey"><span class="span-black">Operational complexity:</span> Franchisees needed an intuitive way to oversee multiple stores and address issues quickly.</p>
                  <p class="work-text grey"><span class="span-black">Lack of focus:</span> Competing platforms either overloaded users with features or neglected essential functionalities, creating a frustrating experience.</p>
                  <p class="work-text grey"><span class="span-black">Scalability limitations:</span> As the company transitioned from smaller franchisees to mega-franchisees managing 50–100 stores, the platform needed to evolve to support large-scale operations.</p>

            <p class="work-text grey span-black">STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS</p>
            <p class="work-text grey">
              To align with company goals, I interviewed key stakeholders, including operations, marketing, and franchise management teams. These conversations clarified the strategic priorities for the platform, such as:</p>
            <p class="work-text grey">→ Minimizing franchisee workloads to reinforce Zé Express's "effortless management" promise.
              <br>→ Ensuring franchisees feel a sense of ownership over their stores.
              <br>→ Highlighting metrics that matter most: operational efficiency, sales, and stock management.
            </p>
            <p class="work-text grey span-black">FRANCHISEE INTERVIEWS</p>
            <p class="work-text grey">Interviews with 4 franchisees revealed their daily workflows, pain points, and expectations for a management platform. Key insights included:</p>
            <p class="work-text grey">→ Franchisees valued light workloads and clear operational guidance.
              <br>→ They wanted the platform to help them identify issues needing immediate attention and save deep analyses for weekly reviews.
              <br>→ Franchisees expected comprehensive yet digestible reporting on store performance, sales trends, and stock status.
              <br>→ They preferred that customer relationships (e.g., complaints, refunds) be handled by Zé Express centrally.
            </p>
            <p class="work-text grey span-black">COMPETITIVE BENCHMARK ANALYSIS</p>
            <p class="work-text grey">We analyzed both Zé Express’s existing back-office platform and competitor franchise platforms. Insights included:</p>
            <p class="work-text grey">→ Existing platforms were too complex for franchisees or narrowly focused on specific tasks.
              <br>→ A balance was needed between offering all necessary features (operations, marketing, finance, communication) and maintaining simplicity and usability.

            <h3 class="work-title black fade-in">Approach</h3>
            <p class="work-text grey span-black">INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE</p>
            <p class="work-text grey">
              We restructured the platform's information architecture to clearly differentiate features for internal teams and franchisees. This involved simplifying navigation and focusing on franchisee-specific needs, such as real-time store monitoring and actionable insights.

            <img class="case-full-img" src="/assets/Information Architecture.png" alt="">
            <p class="work-text grey">Key features included:</p>

              <br><span class="span-black">→ Actionable call-to-action zones</span> on every page to guide users toward resolving pressing issues.
              <br><span class="span-black">→ Customizable reports and filters</span> to address franchisees’ specific operational and financial concerns.

            <img class="case-full-img" src="/assets/Zones.png" alt="">
            <p class="work-text grey span-black">ITERATIVE USABILITY TESTING</p>
            <p class="work-text grey">Prototypes were tested with 4 franchisees and demonstrated at live events. Key findings included:</p>
            <p class="work-text grey">→ New franchisees needed a learning curve to understand platform functionalities.
              <br>→ Comprehensive onboarding materials significantly improved usability during testing.
              <br>→ Feedback from live demonstrations emphasized the need for additional reporting options and filters, which were subsequently added.
